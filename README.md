**isolation** is a two-player strategy board game. It is played on a 7x7 board which is initially filled with squares.

Rules are really simple:
1. Moving one's piece to a neighboring position that contains a square but not the opponent's piece
2. Removing any square with no piece on it

The player who cannot make any move loses the game
